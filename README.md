# Backend of Willmage
This is where all back-end processing such as image uploading is stored. Feel free to self host this - as long as you give us credit for the base code.
________
## Required Node Modules
There's a couple of prerequisites needed to ensure you can properly self host Willmage.
- [Express](https://npmjs.com/express)
- [Express-fileupload](https://npmjs.com/express-fileupload)
- [File-type](https://npmjs.com/file-type)
- [Multer](https://npmjs.com/multer)

Node.js is an obvious requirement. Please keep in mind that we will not provide support for selfhosting.
